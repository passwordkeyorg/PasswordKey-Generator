Features
Strong Passwords: Generate complex, difficult-to-crack passwords for your online accounts.
Secure Password Management: Protect your digital assets with the added layer of security provided by the master key and site tags.
Easy-to-Use: Simplify the task of managing numerous passwords with an intuitive interface.
Customizable Length: Adjust the length of generated passwords to meet your security and memorability requirements.
Untraceable and Secure: Each site's password is distinct and designed to be secure, ensuring the safety of your accounts.
Robust Safety Management: Even if one password is compromised, your other accounts remain protected and retrievable using the same site tag and master key combination.

How It Works
Password Name (Site Tag): Enter a memorable name or tag for each password, making it easy to identify the purpose or site for which the password is generated.

Master Key: Use a central, secure key that you remember to form a crucial part of the password generation algorithm, guaranteeing both uniqueness and security for every password created.

Password Length: Adjust the length of the generated password using a convenient slider, striking a balance between security and memorability.

Password Generation Algorithm: The tool utilizes a combination of the user-provided site tag and the master key to create a base input for each password. A cryptographic hash function, like SHA-256, processes this base input to generate a unique and complex string of characters. The algorithm then applies rules for character diversity, including the use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, to extract a password of the desired length from this complex string.
