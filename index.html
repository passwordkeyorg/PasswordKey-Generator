            <strong>About PasswordKey</strong>
            <p>The "PasswordKey" website offers an innovative approach to enhance your digital security. It uniquely combines the use of a master password and distinct site tags to manage and secure your online accounts. This dual-component system simplifies the task of remembering numerous passwords while maintaining a high level of security.</p>

            <strong>User Input Process:</strong>
            <p>Password Name (Site Tag): The Password Name, also known as the Site Tag, is a unique identifier that users create for each of their passwords. For example, a user might use "Email" as the site tag for their email account and "SocialMedia" for their social media account. This system allows for easy recognition and management of passwords for different online services.</p>

			<p>Master Key: The Master Key is akin to a personal password. It's a private and secure key that the user creates and remembers. Think of it as the core password that, combined with the site tags, forms the foundation for each unique password. It's similar to having one key that can unlock multiple locks when used with the right combination.</p>

			<p>In summary, different combinations of site tags and the Master Key generate different passwords. This dual-component system enhances security by creating unique and strong passwords for each of your online accounts, effectively managing your digital footprint.</p>

            <strong>Password Generation Algorithm:</strong>
            <p>The website utilizes a combination of the user-provided site tag and the master key to create a base input for each password. A cryptographic hash function, like SHA-256, processes this base input to generate a unique and complex string of characters. The algorithm then applies rules for character diversity, including the use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, to extract a password of the desired length from this complex string.</p>

            <strong>Local Processing for Enhanced Security</strong>
			<p>With PasswordKey, every password generation process takes place directly on your device, not transmitted or stored on our servers, thereby significantly enhancing the security of your data. This ensures absolute privacy and security throughout the entire process.</p>

			<strong>Unique Passwords for Each Site</strong>
			<p>PasswordKey enables the creation of different passwords for each of your online accounts. This approach is vital in minimizing risks associated with a single compromised account, effectively preventing a domino effect where one breach could jeopardize multiple accounts. By ensuring each account has a unique password, we enhance the overall safety of your digital identity.</p>

			<strong>Streamlined User Experience</strong>
			<p>PasswordKey combines advanced security with a user-friendly interface, focusing on simplicity and effectiveness in our design philosophy. With PasswordKey, you don't need to remember long and complex passwords; just enter the same tag and master password each time, and your secure password is ready. This method simplifies the entire process while ensuring your security is not compromised.</p>
